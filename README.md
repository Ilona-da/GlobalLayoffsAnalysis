# Layoffs Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset related to global layoffs between March 2020 and March 2023. The goal is to prepare quality data for further visualization and insights using Power BI.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about layoffs in various companies, including:
- Company name
- Industry
- Location
- Number of employees laid off
- Percentage of workforce affected
- Date of layoffs
- Investment funding (in millions)

## Data Cleaning Process
The data cleaning process was conducted using **Microsoft SQL Server** and included the following steps:

1. Removing duplicates
2. Standardizing data
3. Handling NULL and blank values
4. Adjusting data types
5. Removing unwanted records

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to identify key trends and patterns in the dataset. This included mainly:
- Checking overall trends in layoffs over time
- Identifying companies and industries most affected by layoffs
- Examining geographic distribution of layoffs

## Next Steps: Power BI Visualization
The next step in this project is to create dashboards in Power BI to visualize key insights. This will include charts and KPIs showing trends in layoffs across industries, countries, and time periods.

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server** – Data cleaning and preparation
- **Power BI** (upcoming) – Data visualization and dashboard creation

## Repository Structure
- `layoffs_data.csv` - source data file
- `data_cleaning.sql` – SQL script for data cleaning
- `exploratory_data_analysis.sql` – SQL queries for exploratory data analysis
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Author
This project was conducted as part of my portfolio to demonstrate SQL data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization skills.
